# Basket Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes retail data to perform basket segmentation using Python. The goal is to group customer baskets based on purchasing patterns, enabling targeted marketing strategies and better understanding of customer behavior. Techniques like clustering are used to identify different segments of shopping baskets.

## Project Structure
- `data/Retail_data.xlsx`: The dataset containing retail transaction data.
- `notebooks/Basket Segmentation_main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and segmentation process.
- `README.md`: Detailed documentation of the project, including methodology, results, and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the analysis.

## Dataset
The `Retail_data.xlsx` file contains the following columns:
- `InvoiceNo`: Invoice number for each transaction.
- `StockCode`: Unique identifier for each product.
- `Description`: Description of the product.
- `Quantity`: Quantity of each product purchased.
- `InvoiceDate`: Date of the transaction.
- `UnitPrice`: Price per unit of each product.
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Country`: Country where the transaction took place.

## Analysis Methodology
The analysis follows these steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed null values and duplicates from the dataset.
   - Processed the `InvoiceDate` column to extract useful time-based features.
   - Filtered out negative or zero quantities to focus on successful transactions.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized the distribution of purchases over time.
   - Analyzed the most frequently purchased products and their contribution to overall revenue.
   - Identified patterns in customer purchasing behavior.

3. **Basket Segmentation Using Clustering**:
   - Utilized clustering algorithms like K-Means to segment customer baskets based on purchase frequency and value.
   - Determined the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
   - Analyzed the characteristics of each segment to derive insights.

4. **Visualization of Segments**:
   - Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to visualize cluster characteristics.
   - Plotted clusters based on purchase quantity and average basket value.
   - Created heatmaps and bar charts to illustrate the distribution of product categories across segments.

## Results
Key insights from the analysis include:
- **Segmentation of Customer Baskets**: Identified distinct groups of customer baskets, such as high-frequency, low-value customers and occasional, high-value customers.
- **Popular Product Categories**: Certain product categories were found to be popular across multiple segments, driving a large share of the revenue.
- **Customer Purchase Patterns**: Segments revealed different purchasing behaviors, allowing for targeted marketing strategies and personalized promotions.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **Python 3.8+**: The primary programming language used.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Clustering algorithms for segmentation.

## Future Work
- **Advanced Segmentation**: Explore more sophisticated clustering techniques like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering.
- **Association Rule Mining**: Use association rule mining (e.g., Apriori) to identify frequent itemsets and understand product co-purchases.
- **Real-Time Segmentation**: Implement a real-time customer segmentation model using streaming data.
